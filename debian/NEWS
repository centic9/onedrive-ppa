onedrive (2.1.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * OneDrive package switched to new upstream. From upstream's README about
    updating from the previous version:
      Upgrading from 'skilion' client
      The 'skilion' version contains a significant number of defect's in how
      the local sync state is managed. When upgrading from the 'skilion'
      version to this version, it is advisable to stop any service / onedrive
      process from running and then remove any `items.sqlite3` file from your
      configuration directory (`~/.config/onedrive/`) as this will force the
      creation of a new local cache file.
