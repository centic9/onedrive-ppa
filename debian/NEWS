onedrive (2.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The below is an important note regarding the v2.4.0 release.

  As part of the changes required to correctly handle OneDrive 429
  error responses, a decision was taken to change the Client ID.

  What this means is, after upgrading to v2.4.0, on your next sync,
  you will be presented with the following message:

    ERROR: OneDrive returned an error with the following message:
      Error Message: HTTP request returned status code 400 (Bad Request)
      Error Reason:  AADSTS70000: The provided value for the input parameter
      'refresh_token' or 'assertion' is not valid. The token was issued for a different client id
    Trace ID: 06f95eac-45de-478f-8c4c-f1ae4fb90400
    Correlation ID: 9bbb9e17-546b-4f24-abc5-ee46e54ebe53
    Timestamp: 2020-03-22 21:56:29Z

    ERROR: OneDrive returned a 'HTTP 401 Unauthorized' - Cannot Initialize Sync Engine
    ERROR: Check your configuration as your refresh_token may be empty or invalid.
    You may need to issue a --logout and re-authorise this client.

  What you will need to do is:

  Stop any onedrive service (init.d / systemd) process you have running
  Issue a --logout & re-authenticate the client
  If you do not want to do this, then update your 'config' file with the
  following information:

  application_id = "22c49a0d-d21c-4792-aed1-8f163c982546"
  This will continue to use the older 'skilion' client identifier and not
  require re-authentication, however this may increase your chances of
  getting a OneDrive 429 error.

onedrive (2.1.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * OneDrive package switched to new upstream. From upstream's README about
    updating from the previous version:
      Upgrading from 'skilion' client
      The 'skilion' version contains a significant number of defect's in how
      the local sync state is managed. When upgrading from the 'skilion'
      version to this version, it is advisable to stop any service / onedrive
      process from running and then remove any `items.sqlite3` file from your
      configuration directory (`~/.config/onedrive/`) as this will force the
      creation of a new local cache file.
